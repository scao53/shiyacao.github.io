Data science involves applying a set of strategies to transform a recorded set of values into something from which we can glean knowledge and insight. This course introduces students to concepts and methods from the field of data science, along with how to apply them in R. Students learn how to acquire, clean, wrangle, and visualize data. Students also learn best practices in data science workflows, such as code documentation and version control. Issues in data ethics are addressed throughout the course.
